1. The Hook (The Elevator Pitch)
"Most arbitrage bots are just calculators—they see a price gap and they swap. But in the 'wild west' of a new chain, that's how you get rugged by honeypots or malicious code. The Sentinad is an AI agent that doesn't just look at the math; it checks the Vibe. It performs a sub-second AI audit on every smart contract it interacts with, roasting scammers in purple-themed 'Degen Slang' while safely printing MON on legitimate opportunities."

2. The Core Problem
The Gap: Monad's 10,000 TPS means arbitrage happens in milliseconds.

The Risk: Traditional bots aren't "smart"—they can't read code. They often fall for "rug-pulls" where the Sell function is locked.

The Solution: Use Monad’s parallel execution to run an AI-inference "Vibe Check" simultaneously with the price scan.

3. How It Works (The "Sentinad" Workflow)
The Hunt: A scanner constantly monitors price discrepancies between two Monad DEXs (e.g., Kuru vs. a secondary pool).

The Vibe Check (AI Audit): Before the transaction is sent, the agent feeds the target contract's logic into a lightweight LLM (like GPT-4o-mini).

System Prompt: "Audit this code for backdoors. If safe, output 'Gmonad'. If it's a rug, roast the dev in Monad slang."

The Strike: If the "Vibe Check" passes, the agent executes a flash-arbitrage transaction on the Monad chain.

The Terminal: A retro purple dashboard displays the agent's internal "thoughts" to the audience.
